# Cows Open Source Hack N' Slash Game

Made in Unity - 2018.2.x
Updates will be made on the version, once stable builds of Unity releases

Mutliplayer 3D TopDown Hack N' Slash Game for; Windows, iOS and Linux

Art style:
= 
Low Poly, high detailed particles, and well shaded, and textured

Gameplay:
=
Top-down RPG-ish game. Draws a lot of inspiration from the Diablo Series and Torchlight. 
Combat should be Bullet-Hell type of, to add a high skill-ceiling to the game, aswell as challenge all the time.
This Bullet-Hell element, might limited too; Bosses, or high-level enemies.
The game should be quite the grindy one, too add a lot of playtime, while minimizing content creation. 
(Sounds shitty, I know)

## Before joining the project:
Thank you for even considering joining the project. I truly appriciate every single (meaningfull) contribution made to the project. Sadly I can not accept every request there is, because either: 1. It has already been done, or 2. It did not meet the ___GUIDELINES___, or 3. It simply did not fit with game. If 1, or 3 was the case, please dont be discouraged, I still appraciate the effort and work you put in, and I hope to see another addition from you. 
Point 1, does not apply to rewrites of code, or redoings of models or other assets. The original creator of said asset will still be credited. Don't take this as a "Wow, how rude! He replaced my <insert asset here>!" Rather take it as a opportunity too see what you could potentionally improve, or something that you could have done in a different way.
